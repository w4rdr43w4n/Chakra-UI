## Overview
This NextJs Project is a collection of Chakra UI library components to practice UI/UX and to make it easy to find and create such components for future projects.

## What's inside?
This Project contains by now the following features:
* A working Login/Register authentication System.
* Some pretty UI components in the login or register pages only

## Notes && Usage
* This Project was generated with [bun](https://bun.sh) , a new very fast JS runtime and package manager, so it's preferable to install dependencies with:
```
bun i
```
Then you can run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
# or
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
